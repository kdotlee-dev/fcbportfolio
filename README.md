# Frontend Website

A beginner-friendly frontend website project created as part of a free coding bootcamp.

## About This Project

This project was developed following instructions from a Zuitt instructor during a free coding bootcamp session held on October 15, 2025 at 1:00 PM UTC+08:00. 
It serves as a hands-on introduction to frontend development and automated deployment workflows.

## Deployment

This website is automatically deployed using GitHub Actions. Every time changes are pushed to the repository, GitHub Actions runs a workflow that builds and deploys the website automatically.

### How It Works

1. Push code changes to the repository
2. GitHub Actions automatically triggers the deployment workflow
3. The website is built and deployed to the hosting platform
4. Changes go live without any manual intervention

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser
- Git installed on a computer
- A GitHub account

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-name>
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website locally

### Making Changes

1. Edit the HTML, CSS files as needed
2. Test changes locally by opening the files in a browser
3. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"
   ```
4. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
5. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy the updates
